# ROKAB

A Rise of Kingdoms answering bot that uses Selenium and ShareX OCR for automated question answering.

This bot is designed to be **unpatchable** in the traditional sense because it does **not interact with the game client at all**. Unlike typical game bots, it does not inject code, modify memory, or simulate in-game actions. Instead, it works entirely on the **user‚Äôs screen**:

- It captures text from screenshots using ShareX OCR.
- It sends the captured text to ChatGPT for processing.
- It returns answers in a popup ‚Äî completely outside the game environment.

Because it operates only on visual data and standard browser/API interactions, updates to the game **cannot break the bot**. Additionally, the bot is highly **configurable** ‚Äî by changing the "prefix" or context in the configuration, it can be adapted to work with **any application or game** that uses text-based questions, not just Rise of Kingdoms.  

This approach ensures that:
- You are never altering the game client.
- The bot is resilient to updates and patches.
- It remains fully cross-platform compatible with minimal maintenance.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Notice:**  
For legal and ethical reasons, this project **will not accept suggestions or features that automatically click or submit answers in-game**. All interactions with the game must be manual.  
However, I may create an **educational tutorial in the future** that explores image processing and automated answer detection in a controlled, non-game context. This would be purely for learning purposes and not intended for use in any live game environment.

- Check that your antivirus isn't blocking the executable
- Try running as administrator

If OCR doesn't work:
- Verify ShareX is properly installed
- Check that your hotkey is set correctly
- Ensure the OCR task settings are configured

If ChatGPT doesn't respond:
- Make sure you're logged into ChatGPT
- Check your internet connection
